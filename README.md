# Empowered Conversations

## Pitch

Disclaimer: This project requires use of the Twilio API to fully function.  Only sign up for this one if you are interested in learning how to integrate Twilio into the project.

Empowered Conversation aims to re-envision the future of social support. With our text-based tool, the person you want to have a “hard conversation” with will be texted before the conversation with a heads-up so they can emotionally prepare themselves. From sexual assault disclosure to coming out, transitioning, grief and loss, we set the stage for relationships that are radically more supportive and meaningful than you ever imagined they could be.
